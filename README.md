# Search
A front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search. The goal of this project is to be as aesthetically similar to
Google's search pages as possible and give the same results as Google for any given query. Particularly, [index.html](/index.html) is the page
for Google Search, [img_search.html](/img_search.html) is the page for Google Image Search and [advanced_search.html](/advanced_search.html) is
the page for Google Advanced Search. It is currently hosted at https://onyenso.github.io/search/. No mobile view was designed for this project.
